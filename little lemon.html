JavaScript: If you want to add interactivity (like a booking form), you can include a JavaScript file.

Placeholder Image Services:

Lorem Picsum
Unsplash
Pexels
Placehold.it
Example Image URLs: You can use the following URLs as placeholders in your HTML code:

Little Lemon Logo:

Copy code
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x50?text=Little+Lemon+Logo" alt="Little Lemon Logo">
Little Lemon Small Logo:

html

Run
Copy code
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/100x30?text=Little+Lemon" alt="Little Lemon Small Logo">
Updated HTML Example: Here’s how you can integrate these placeholder images into your HTML:

html

You can replace the placeholder URLs with actual images once you have them. If you need specific images related to food or restaurants, you can search for them on Unsplash or Pexels, which offer high-quality images for free.
